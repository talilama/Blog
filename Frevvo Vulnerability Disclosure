Analysis Of Zip Slip Authenticated Remote Code Execution
--------------------------------------------------------

An authenticated application user with the Frevvo.designer role has the ability to create new projects. One method for creating a project is to select the “Upload Project” option and uploading a project zip file:

!["upload project" is highlighted on the Frevvo software screenshot by White Oak Security](https://blog.cyberadvisors.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/image-3.png?width=974&height=654&name=image-3.png)

To determine the structure of the project file, White Oak Security created a new blank project, then selected “Download project zip file”:

The zip file contained a META-INF directory with a manifest, as well as a directory with a unique ID that contained an XML file with an “.application” extension. White Oak Security added a file “test.txt” with a directory traversal to test for a Zip Slip vulnerability:

Because this was tested on an on-premise install, White Oak Security had the benefit of local access to the web server filesystem. Upon uploading the file, we can search for it within the Frevvo tomcat directory and find that “test.txt” is written to the Tomcat base directory:

For Tomcat, we will need to upload a JSP shell to the webapps/ROOT/directory to obtain remote code execution. The following file structure within the malicious zip file was used to achieve this goal:

Uploading the malicious “zipslipproject.zip” within the “Upload Project” functionality sends the following request:

The resulting file is successfully uploaded and unzipped to the webroot and, achieving remote code execution (in this test instance the application is running as root – don’t do this in production!):

Frevvo fixed this issue by rejecting any zip file upload that attempts to extract files outside of the working directory.
